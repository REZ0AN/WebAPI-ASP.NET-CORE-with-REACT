# WebAPI-ASP.NET-Core-with-REACT

In this `WebAPI-ASP.NET-Core-with-REACT` project, I aim to learn and work with the .NET framework, understanding how everything works from the database (PostgreSQL) connection to the frontend (React) integration. The backend, built with ASP.NET Core WebApi, connects to a PostgreSQL database to manage data, while the frontend, powered by React, communicates with the API to display and handle the data.
